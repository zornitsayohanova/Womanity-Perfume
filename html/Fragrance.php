        Thierry Mugler made a perfume that will follow every mood and fit your emotions.
        Just three scent notes but what incredible three notes – fig, caviar and fig tree.
        They say it all. The lushness of fruit and the roughness and strength of the sea.
        And the mystery. But is there a greater mystery than a woman?

            And just like Aphrodite,

        <div class="left-text text">
            every woman embodies the lushness and sweetness of a fig
            and the untamable sea of emotions, the calm of an open water and the rough waves. Womanity has middle aura and a strong sillage,
            a scent trail that will follow you wherever you go.
